# What is DNA
- a system for easily viewing and analyzing EDN
- EDN -> ADN -> DNA
- Reduces complex database to drag-and-drop pivot table

# Where Does DNA Fit In?

![](file://cdc/project/ccid_ncpdcid_dgmq/IRMH/_Epi%20Team/DNA/DNA-High-level-001.jpg)

# DNA includes data from:
 - AIS (1997--2000)
 - IMP (2000--2009)
 - EDN (2007--present)

# How to access DNA
* via SQL-Server
* Excel
 ** make connection
 * drag-and-drop
 * set it and forget it
 * update when needed

# Where to Find DNA Documentation?

![](file://cdc/project/ccid_ncpdcid_dgmq/IRMH/_Epi%20Team/DNA/DNA documentation location.png)


# Which Value?
- 'All' counts all records from AIS, IMP, EDN
- For AIS and IMP, limitted data 
- - Only arrival date, TB class, country of birth 
- vw EDN for counts of EDN records
 - - Every field in DS forms available
- WRAPS for counts of DOS refugee records
 -- Nationality, ethnicity, language, marital status, relationship

# DNA dimensions
- dimensions like a variable, but may be cascading
- flat dimension
- Cascading dimension

# Date ranges
- Fiscal or calendar year
- Month of year (May, 2012) or calendar month (May)
- Same for quarter, week, and day

# Table showing No. Records for 3 Systems

# Table showing arrivals by Q station

# Table showing arrival by Visa Type and Class B TB

# Cumulative Refugee Arrivals

```

- 2003--2008, strong seasonal pattern
- - 1,179 arrived September27, 2008
- Since 2007, fewer extreme days
- then mean number of refugee arrivals is `r mean(dat$total)`
